# Glue Framework

This is a first git commit of a framework I made as a personal pet project to learn how MVCs in PHP worked.

It is heavily based upon Yii and makes use of certain patterns they also do.

It is very small and basic but I have been able to make a couple of very specialist sites out of it.

Not all dependancies are fullfilled by this Git, and applications folder and more would be required to get this framework to work
